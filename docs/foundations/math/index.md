# Math Foundations for Data Science

This section is designed to help you build the essential math skills needed to get started in data science and machine learning.

You don't need to be a math expert to begin. The goal here is to give you just enough understanding so that concepts in data analysis, modeling, and machine learning feel less like magic and more like tools you can reason about.

The explanations are written for beginners. Wherever possible, we’ll include simple examples, diagrams, and code to show how the math connects to real data science tasks.

## Why Math Matters in Data Science

You may be using tools like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or TensorFlow — but those tools are built on math. Understanding what’s happening under the hood helps you:

- Use tools more effectively and avoid mistakes
- Make better decisions when choosing or tuning models
- Read documentation and papers with more confidence
- Understand error messages or unexpected results

You don’t need to master every topic right away. Start small and build over time.

## Topics Covered

### Linear Algebra  
This introduces vectors and matrices, which are the backbone of most machine learning algorithms. We’ll focus on the basics: how they work, how to multiply them, and why that matters.


### Statistics  
Statistics helps us describe data and make inferences. We’ll look at averages, variance, and common distributions, and explain how they apply to data science workflows.

### Calculus  
Only the parts you need. We'll explain what derivatives and gradients are, and how they relate to training models — especially for deep learning.


### Geometry & Distance  
Many models rely on measuring how similar or different things are. This section introduces distance metrics and how they’re used in practice.

## How to Use This Section

You can go through the topics in order, or jump to the ones you’re most interested in. Each topic is written to stand on its own, with links to help you connect ideas as you go.

If something doesn’t make sense at first — that’s normal. Take your time, revisit ideas, and try to connect them to examples.

Start with algebra, and build from there.
